Course Project for CSCI 4314: MolecularBio/ Dynamic Models in Biology

Simulating a target (human) with an odor (diffuses according to basic model) moving on a path
and an agent (perhaps a dog) who is searching for the target with various strategies.

The project's goal is to find a good strategy for finding the target. We could either view this 
as a model for search and rescue or even a model of predator tracking prey by chemical (scent) signals.
What is the best strategy?
